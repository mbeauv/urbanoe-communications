- [urbanoe-redux](https://github.com/mbeauv/urbanoe-redux): Defines the interface to the urbanoe server.

Module defining Redux actions and reducers to interact with the urbanoe server.  The interfaces are defined using Flow and all of the types can be found in the urbanoe-model module.  This module is usable both in React and React Native.
